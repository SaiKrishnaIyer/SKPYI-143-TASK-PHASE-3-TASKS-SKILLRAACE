## Countdown Timer in Python

This Python script demonstrates a simple countdown timer. It takes an input time in seconds and counts down to zero, displaying the remaining time at regular intervals.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x

### Implementation Details

The `countdown_timer.py` script uses the `time` module to handle time-related operations. Here's a brief overview of its functionality:

- **Input**: The script prompts the user to enter the countdown duration in seconds.
  
- **Countdown**: Using a `while` loop, it continuously updates and displays the remaining time until it reaches zero.

- **Display**: The current remaining time is displayed every second using the `time.sleep()` function to pause execution.

- **Completion**: Once the countdown reaches zero, a message indicating completion is displayed.

### Example

Hereâ€™s how the countdown timer works in action:

```bash
$ python countdown_timer.py
Enter the countdown duration in seconds: 10
Countdown started...

Remaining time: 10 seconds
Remaining time: 9 seconds
Remaining time: 8 seconds
Remaining time: 7 seconds
Remaining time: 6 seconds
Remaining time: 5 seconds
Remaining time: 4 seconds
Remaining time: 3 seconds
Remaining time: 2 seconds
Remaining time: 1 second
Countdown complete!
```

### Further Customization

Feel free to customize the script further based on your requirements.
